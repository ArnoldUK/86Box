# 86Box
System Configs and Setups for 86Box

I will be adding some system setups and documents for anyone using the 86Box virtual pc emulator.

Build V2.07 (Fixed in Build 3.x)
Mouse cursor corruption using ATI Graphics Pro Turbo (Mach64) in Windows 3.1 and 95.
This happens with all driver versions and resolutions including default Windows 95 driver.

Temporary Fix and Workaround
For Windows 95:
Change the mouse pointers scheme to 3D Pointers from within the mouse control panel.
